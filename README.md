# Web-Design-Challenge

This challenge creates a visualization dashboard website using weather data.

The asset folder includes a jupyter notebook that converts a csv file to html using pandas. The Resources folder contains the cities.csv file (the data used for this data analysis). The visualizations folder holds all the png files of the latitude vs. weather charts.  

The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

- A landing page with an explanation of the project and a sidebar containing preview images of each plot (clicking an image takes the user to that visualization).
- Four visualization pages, each with a descriptive title and heading tag.
- A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
- A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
